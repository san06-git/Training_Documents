	Kubernetes ::::
	
		- It is a Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool 
		- Kubernetes is used to Deploy any type of Containers.
		- It is used to ensure high availability of the Applications/services running thru Containers.
		- Used to Ensure High Availability of Containers by creating Replicas of Containers.
		- It supports Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing.
		- Self-Healing

	Installation & Configuration of Kubernetes_Master & Kubernetes_WorkNodes 

	Managed Services :	- Paid Service!
	
		AWS 	- ECS/ECR/EKS 
		
		Azure 	- ACS/ACR/AKS 
		
		GCP 	- GCR/GKE	
		
	
	Open-Source Kubernetes :::
	
		https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/
		
		
		Kubernetes_Master			(VM)
			Kubernetes_WorkNode1	(VM)
			Kubernetes_WorkNode2	(VM)
			
			
		Minikube 		--> 	1 Node Configuration
			VM -> 
			
		Kubeadm -->
		
		
	Installation of Kubernetes using Kubeadm :::	
	
		1. Launch 3 VMs on AWS Cloud (Ubuntu v22.04) --> (1 Master Node, 2 WorkerNodes)
		
		In all the Nodes(i.e., Master Node and WorkerNodes):
		
			2. Allow all traffic for all the nodes - just for this demo
			3. Change the HostName of all the Nodes
			4. Disable swap configuration in all the nodes
			5. Install Docker in all the nodes
			6. Install CRI - 'Container-D' in all the nodes
			7. Install Kubeadm,kubelet,kubectl 
			8. Enable Kubelet	
		   
		Only on Master Node:
		
			9. Execute Kubeadm Init Command 		# To initialize Kubernetes Master Node
			10. Enable user Access to Kubernetes
			11. Install flannel Network plugins for kubeproxy

		Only on WorkerNodes:		
		
			12. Execute Kubeadm Join Command 		# To attach the Worknodes with Kubernetes Master Node.
			
				kubeadm join 172.31.8.101:6443 --token 7nd74g.qf0o7ntrb9im3hqr \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:20a690f48ba814666bf93da0a3460e53b46992e339a515bc2dd4f4a1bbf5d4b1

		
	Deploy a new pod in Kubernetes cluster :::
	
	1. Write a manifest file - save as *.yaml 
	
		- Yaml files are based on key:value pairs 
	
	2. Use kubectl command to create/deploy the pod using the manifest file
	
	


How to install and configure kubernetes Master and workernodes 

Write a manifest file to create a pod 

Using kubectl to create a pod 

get/describe/login

expose pod using nodeport services 

access the application running inside the pod using web browser

delete pod and svc

	Controller Object :::
		ReplicaSet 
		Deployment 


	ReplicaSet :::
	
		--> Replicaset is used to execute the specific no. of pods in the cluster.
		--> Replicaset uses the Set Based Operator
		--> Used to replicate the pods and able to scale up/down
		--> The Replicasets will be automatically created, while creating Deployment Controller Object.
	
	Deployment Controller Object :::
	
		--> It is used to deploy the pods and ensure high availability of pods by creating pod replicas 
		--> 1. Create Muliple instance/replicas/copies of pods 
			2. Used to Scale-Up / Scale-Down the Pods 
			3. Used to Upgrade the application pods 
			4. Used to Down-grade/roll-back the application pods
		--> The upgrade/down-grade of application pods can be done without any downtime. 
		--> To achieve zero-downtime during upgrade/down-grade, By Default, it used Rolling-Update Deployment Strategy.
		
	UseCase :::
	
		- Deploy 3 instance pod using Deployment Controller Object 	--> Nginx_previous_version
		- 
		
		
	Output ::
	
		- Deployment Object 
		
		- Replicaset 
		
		- Pods 
	
	
	Web Application :::
	
		Launched a Website!
		
			--> 3 instances of pod to deploy this application 
			
				100 Users can access my application 
				
				1000 ++++
				2000 ++++
				
				
				Scale-up the pod instances !
				Scale-down the pod instances !

	Deployment Controller Object :::
	
		--> It is used to deploy the pods and ensure high availability of pods by creating pod replicas 
		--> 1. Create Muliple instance/replicas/copies of pods 
			2. Used to Scale-Up / Scale-Down the Pods 
			3. Used to Upgrade the application pods 
			4. Used to Down-grade/roll-back the application pods
		--> The upgrade/down-grade of application pods can be done without any downtime. 
		--> To achieve zero-downtime during upgrade/down-grade, By Default, it used Rolling-Update Deployment Strategy.	

	

		- Upgrade the application pods 
		- Down-grade/roll-back the application pods
		
		
	What is the need for Kubectl describe Command ???
	
	- Kubectl Describe Command is used to capture the complete information about the kubenetes objects
	- Kubectl Describe Command provides the complete list of events based on the kubernetes object. 
	- Kubectl Describe Command is used to diagonize/debug/analyze the kubernetes objects 



	Developer created --> webappimg:v1.0 ==> Publish to container Registry	==> Deployed to kubernetes
	Developer created --> webappimg:v2.0 ==> Publish to container Registry	==> Deployed to kubernetes
	
	
	Deployment Strategy :::
	
		nginx-deploy ---> nginx:stable-otel(v1.0)	# Current version of Application Image 
		
			pod1	---> nginx:stable-otel(v1.0)		# Current version of Application Image
			pod2	---> nginx:stable-otel(v1.0)		# Current version of Application Image
			pod3 	---> nginx:stable-otel(v1.0)		# Current version of Application Image
	
	
	

		Upgrade the Application Image from nginx:stable-otel(v1.0) to nginx:stable-pearl(v2.0)

		nginx-deploy ---> nginx:stable-pearl(v2.0)	# Current version of Application Image 

			pod1	---> nginx:stable-pearl(v2.0)		# Current version of Application Image
			pod2	---> nginx:stable-pearl(v2.0)		# Current version of Application Image
			pod3 	---> nginx:stable-pearl(v2.0)		# Current version of Application Image


		--> To achieve zero-downtime during upgrade/down-grade, By Default, it used Rolling-Update Deployment Strategy.	

		During the Upgrade, if anything goes wrong, we can quickly roll-back to previous version
		
		
		First will see how to deploy any new version of image, for roll-back 


		roll-back - When will go for roll-back ???
		
			Whenever the deployment fails, will go for roll-back/undo the changes 
		
			when pod is not running as expected
			when we need to use previous version 
			
			
			
	Kubernetes Services :::
	
		Services are used to enable the communication to the pods :::
		
		
		- Cluster-IP Service:
			- It is used to enable the communication between the pods within the cluster 
		
		- Node-Port Service 
			- It is used to expose the pods to internet
			- Uses the port range : 30000 to 32767 
		
		- Load Balancer Service

			- Is used to reduce the number of IPs address to be maintained for NodePort Service.
			
			- Load Balancer Service Created on top of the NodePort Service, will receives the request from end user thru internet and Route the request the corresponding nodeport service and access the pod within that.		
		
		
		3-tier application :
		
			- Front-End
			
			- Application-Layer 
			
			- Data-Base Layer
